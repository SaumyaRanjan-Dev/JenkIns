# Why use Jenkins over the other tools? Jenkins pros and cons.

Jenkins is one of the most popular open-source continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) tools available today. Here are some reasons why developers and organizations might choose Jenkins over other similar products, followed by its pros and cons.

## Why Choose Jenkins?

## Key Reasons to Choose Jenkins

1. **Open Source**: Jenkins is free and open-source. It allows you to modify and customize it according to your needs without incurring any licensing costs.
2. **Extensive Plugin Ecosystem**: Jenkins has a vast ecosystem of plugins. Whether you want to integrate with version control systems, build tools, deployment platforms, or any other tools in the CI/CD pipeline, there’s likely a plugin for it.
3. **Active Community**: Because Jenkins is widely used, it has an active community. This means a lot of resources, tutorials, solutions to common problems, and community support are available.
4. **Platform Independence**: Jenkins can be installed on various operating systems and platforms.
5. **Easy Scalability**: Jenkins nodes can easily be added for scalability, allowing you to run builds on different machines with different operating systems.
6. **Pipeline Support**: With the Pipeline plugin, Jenkins provides a domain-specific language for scripting complex workflows and pipelines.
7. **Integrates with Nearly Everything**: Jenkins can integrate with the most popular tools in the software development lifecycle.
8. **Longevity**: Being one of the earliest CI/CD tools, Jenkins has stood the test of time and has evolved over the years.

## Pros of Jenkins

- **Flexibility**: Highly configurable due to its plugin-based architecture.
- **Widely Adopted**: Given its age and maturity, it’s widely known in the industry, making it easier to find resources or hire talent with Jenkins experience.
- **Frequent Updates**: The active community and developer base mean that the tool is frequently updated.
- **Self-hosted**: Allows for on-premises setup, giving teams control over the environment and security.
- **Distributed Builds**: You can set up master and agent architecture to distribute the build and test loads.

## Cons of Jenkins

- **Complex Setup**: While Jenkins is powerful, it often requires considerable time and effort to set up, especially for complex workflows.
- **UI/UX**: Jenkins’ user interface is sometimes criticized for not being as intuitive or modern compared to newer CI/CD tools.
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Frequent updates, although a strength, can also mean that teams need to spend time keeping Jenkins and its plugins up-to-date. There’s also a chance of plugins becoming incompatible with newer versions.
- **Performance**: As your project grows, you might experience some performance issues. Proper maintenance and optimization can mitigate this, but it’s an overhead.
- **Documentation**: While there’s a lot of community content, the official documentation can sometimes be lacking in clarity or comprehensiveness.
- **Security Concerns**: Jenkins has had security vulnerabilities in the past. It’s crucial to keep it and its plugins updated to avoid potential threats.

## Conclusion

While Jenkins offers powerful capabilities and flexibility, it requires a dedicated effort to set up, maintain, and optimize. When considering Jenkins, it’s essential to evaluate your team’s specific needs, available expertise, and willingness to manage the overhead associated with it. Newer CI/CD tools may offer smoother experiences or cloud-native features out of the box, but Jenkins remains a robust and highly customizable choice.
